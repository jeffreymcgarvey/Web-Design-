I only just skimmed the surface of the HTML tutorial, but I plan on diving into it further this coming week.
I did learn valuable distinctions between HTML (behind the scenes), CSS (what's displayed), and Javascreipt (who runs the show).
I like to think of it as a stage play, with HTML acting as the crew, CSS the actors, and Javascript the director
I also downloaded Atom so I can start using a text editor
I also learned that when an adding alternative attributes to images (for the sake of easy accessiblity and broad viewership),
it's wise to keep it as clean and simple as possible.
