    <h1>Where Are They Now?</h1>
    <p>My pitch is to produce a website that provides fun information about the current state of former beloved child actors.
      <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
      <p>Because leading a project in a computer-based class when I have the computer skills of a 90 year-old sounds like an anxious ordeal and I'd rather join <strong>your</strong> team!
        <h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
        <p>Hopefully nothing! But just in case...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gather information and media files about various has-beens</li>
          <li>Organize information in an attractive, easy to follow manner</li>
          <li>Bring snacks in order for us to have snacks</li>
          <li>Provide links to relevant web sources</li>
          <li>Potentially incorporate elements from our visual and audio unit</li>
